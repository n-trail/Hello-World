                            Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa, the son of Maye Musk (n√©e Haldeman), a model and dietitian from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, and sailor. He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974). His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. His maternal grandfather was American, from Minnesota. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria, which Musk chose two years after his parents split up, but now says was "not a good idea". As an adult, Musk has severed relations with his father. He has a half-sister, and half-brother.
